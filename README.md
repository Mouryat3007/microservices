### E-commerce Microservices Project

This project is a simple e-commerce application implemented using microservices architecture. The application consists of three microservices:

User Service: Manages user information.
Product Service: Manages product catalog.
Order Service: Manages customer orders.
Each service is containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.

Prerequisites
Docker: Install Docker to build and run the containers.
Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (locally using Minikube or on a cloud provider).
Jenkins: Set up a Jenkins server for CI/CD.
Python: Python 3.9+ to run the services locally.
Setup and Deployment
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-microservices.git
```
cd ecommerce-microservices
3. Build and Run Locally with Docker Compose
bash
Copy code

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
User Service: Accessible at http://localhost:5000/users
Product Service: Accessible at http://localhost:5001/products
Order Service: Accessible at http://localhost:5002/orders
3. Build Docker Images
bash
Copy code
```bash
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/user-service:latest ./user-service
```
```bash
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/product-service:latest ./product-service
```
```bash
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/order-service:latest ./order-service
```
4. Push Docker Images to Docker Hub
Copy code
```bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/user-service:latest
```
```bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/product-service:latest
```
```bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/order-service:latest
```

5. Deploy to Kubernetes
Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running.

Apply the Kubernetes manifests:
```bash
 kubectl apply -f home-deployment.yml
```
```bash
 kubectl apply -f home-service.yml
```
bash
Copy code
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/user-service-deployment.yml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/product-service-deployment.yml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/order-service-deployment.yml
```
Verify that all services are running:
bash
Copy code
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```bash
kubectl get services
```
6. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a Jenkinsfile for automating the CI/CD process.

Jenkins Setup:
Credentials:

Docker Hub credentials (dockerhub-credentials)
Kubernetes config file (kubeconfig-credentials)
Pipeline Execution:

The pipeline will build the Docker images, push them to Docker Hub, and deploy the services to the Kubernetes cluster.
Monitoring and Scaling
Scaling: You can scale the services using Kubernetes by updating the replicas in the deployment files:
bash
Copy code
kubectl scale deployment user-service --replicas=4
Monitoring: Consider integrating monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, and logging tools like the ELK stack.
